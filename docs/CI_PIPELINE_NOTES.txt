CI Pipeline Setup – Notes & Difficulties
=========================================

1. VS Code Remote SSH setup was tricky
   - Needed to install OpenSSH on VM
   - VS Code authentication took long to complete

2. GitHub repo was missing initially
   - Forgot to create the repo before push
   - Caused "repository not found" error

3. GitHub Actions didn't recognize my test files
   - pytest not installed
   - Then: 0 tests collected
   - Then: import error due to module not found

4. PYTHONPATH confusion
   - Needed to add PYTHONPATH=src
   - Didn't work as a direct command → solved by setting `env` block in YAML

5. Final Fix
   - Changed import path to: `from python_app.main import greet`
   - Added `env: PYTHONPATH=src` in `python-ci.yml`
   - Green pipeline
